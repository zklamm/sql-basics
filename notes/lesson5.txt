What to Focus On

What schema does an application require?
Being able to map the data used by a project to a database schema is an important skill.

Project setup is secondary.
We do a lot of configuration in this lesson to get the application connecting to a database, logging out queries, etc. You aren't expected to be able to do these things off the top of your head- they are great examples of concepts you should be aware of, but can easily look up if and when you need to implement them.

Summary

In this lesson we've taken a small web application that was using sessions to persist its data and modified it to use a PostgreSQL database instead. We've seen how to:

Extract the session-specific functionality into the SessionPersistence class.
Replace our use of SessionPersistence with DatabasePersistence to store data in a different location without making other changes to the application.
Safely handle inserting parameters into SQL statements with PG::Connection#exec_params.
Use a configure(:development) block for environment-specific settings.
Reload our code in development using sinatra/reloader.
Log database queries made by our application.
We also saw how extracting code into a SessionPersistence class exposed an API that defined the functionality of the application.
