What to Focus On

Relational data is the key feature of relational databases: it's even in the name! Use the following guidelines to focus your study and practice.

Focus on how to work with multiple tables using JOIN.
There are several types of JOINs. Spend most of your time working with the types we cover in this lesson.

SQL has a lot of optional keywords.
We generally prefer a very explicit style of SQL, which is what is shown in this course. Using this style will help you read and comprehend what a given SQL statement does. You will see a variety of styles on the internet, however.

Think about how schemas change over time.
Many of the assignments in this lesson include changing both a database's schema and the data held within it. When solving problems, consider if it's possible with the current schema or if a schema change will be required.

Summary

Relational databases are called relational because they persist data in a set of relations, or, as they are more commonly called, tables.

A relationship is a connection between entity instances, or rows of data, usually resulting from a relationship between what those rows of data represent.

The three levels of schema are conceptual, logical, and physical.

The three types of relationships are one to one, one to many, and many to many.

A conceptual schema is a high-level design focused on identifying entities and their relationships.

A physical schema is a low-level database-specific design focused on implementation.

Cardinality is the number of objects on each side of the relationship.

The modality of a relationship indicates if that relationship is required or not.

Referential integrity is a data property that requires every value in one column of a table to appear in a column of (usually) another table.
