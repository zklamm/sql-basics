What to Focus On

Optimization is something to be aware of.
A database-backed application can be slow for a variety of reasons. In general, an application that makes fewer queries will be faster than one that makes more, but optimizing application performance is a complex topic that is beyond the scope of this course.

You should be aware of the concept of optimizing the way an application interacts with a database after completing this lesson. You should be able to describe what N+1 queries are and how they can be addressed.

You should understand what indexes are, how to implement them, and the trade-offs involved in using them.

You should be aware of the concept of comparing different SQL statements.

Subqueries can be useful.
You should know what a subquery is and how to use it, but you aren't expected to know everything about them. Many queries can be accomplished using JOINS or subqueries, and knowing which is the best requires understanding a lot about the specific scenario being considered. This isn't something you are expected to master at this point in your studies.

Summary
__________


In this lesson, we learned about:

How N+1 queries are the result of performing an additional query for each element in a collection
How to move business logic from Ruby into the database by adding to a query's select list
How making database interactions more efficient often involves making SQL queries more specialized
How indexes can be used as part of database optimization
Comparing the performance of SQL statements
Using subqueries as an alternative to joins
